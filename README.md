# EggCounterLvl1

I thought it could be fun to make 20 Android App Ideas according to Philipp Lackner (you can find his video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKzJGcewyUU&ab_channel=PhilippLackner)).

So this is the first one in this series - EggCounter. 

In this App I used these "fancy" things: ViewModel.
